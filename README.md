# Traditional Mongolian Language Enablement (mlreq)

This is the place to explore gaps in support for languages that use the Traditional Mongolian script on the Web and in eBooks, and to document requirements.

We aim to address the problem that local users don't know how to tell the W3C what problems exist for support of their language on the Web, and the W3C doesn't know how to contact people who can help when questions arise.

Topics for discussion are suggested by [the gap-analysis template](https://www.w3.org/International/i18n-activity/templates/gap-analysis/gap-analysis_template.html). This work feeds into the [language matrix](https://www.w3.org/International/typography/gap-analysis/language-matrix.html) which provides a heat-map for language issues on the Web.

### Feedback
Please use the [GitHub issue list](https://github.com/w3c/mlreq/issues) to report issues for language support, for discussions, and to send feedback about documents. (Learn [how GitHub issues work](https://www.w3.org/International/i18n-activity/guidelines/issues.html).)

Note that the public-i18n-mongolian mailing list is used to send notification digests & meeting minutes. It is **not** for technical discussion.

**You may raise issues in Chinese, however any substantive discussions should be summarised in English at some point, so that non-Chinese speakers can follow the rationale and contribute comments.**
