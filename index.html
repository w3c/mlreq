    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <section id="h_about_this_document">
      <h3>About this document</h3>

      <p>This standard describes the Mongolian format standard, which can be used and achieve implementation in the CSS, SVG and XSL-FO, and it can also be used as the reference documents for office software. It mainly focuses on the Mongolian script and its features, the basic module of Mongolian text, page layout, new CSS standard and accessories.</p>


      <section id="scope">
      <h4>Scope</h4>
      <p>The document describes the rules of composition of various types of text written in traditional Mongolian script and pictures, etc. in various network formats. The purpose of this standard is not to provide complete solution, but to describe the important basic information needed in the implementation in a computer.</p>
<p>The main purpose of this document is to provide standardization and guiding rules for the display and application of traditional Mongolian script in the web. However, the more complex layout requirements such as paper layout are not included in this document. Thus, this document includes the most basic rules of display of page and characters of the traditional Mongolian script, aiming at formulating the corresponding standards of web display and application of Mongolian script for the web application vendors to follow this standard of display and application of Mongolian script in the web.</p>

      </section>


      <section id="terminology">
      <h4>Terminology</h4>
      <p>The following terms and definitions apply to this standard.</p>
      <dl>
      <dt>Composition</dt>
      <dd>The composition in the W3C Standard Format includes Mongolian characters, punctuation marks, and other marks related to the script.</dd>
      <dt>Mongolian Space</dt>
      <dd>Two spaces are used in Mongolian, <span class="codepoint" translate="no"><span class="uname">U+0020 SPACE</span></span> and the  Mongolian space <span class="codepoint" translate="no"><span class="uname">U+202F NARROW NO-BREAK SPACE</span></span>.</dd>
      <dt>Mongolian Symbols</dt>
      <dd>This refers to various symbols used in Mongolian text. In formulating the Mongolian coding standard, some of the codes is used in the coding area of the Mongolian standard, while the rest are symbols used in the scripts of other ethnic groups, due to the fact that some symbols are borrowed from other ethnic groups. </dd>
      <dt>Baseline</dt>
      <dd>Baseline in Mongolian is called “Nirogo”. Mongolian writing is generally aligned to the baseline. </dd>
      <dt>Writing Direction</dt>
      <dd>It refers to the default direction of writing. For example, English writing direction is horizontal from top to bottom, while the Mongolian writing is vertical from left to right. </dd>
      <dt>Text Width</dt>
      <dd>Text width indicates the distance from the word at the left start to the word at the right ead in a line in Mongolian, in the equivalent of the height of the horizontal  English or Chinese text writing. </dd>
      <dt>Text Height</dt>
      <dd>Text height refers to the height of a Mongolian word, in equivalent of the width of the horizontal English or Chinese text writing. </dd>
      <dt>Text Spacing</dt>
      <dd>Text spacing refers to the gap between the Mongolian words.</dd>
      <dt>Leftline and Rightline</dt>
      <dd>As the Mongolian writing is vertical, the right line, the left line and the line through is equivalent to the underline and overline in the horizontal English or Chinese text writing. </dd>

  <section id="h_gap_analysis">
  <h3>Gap analysis</h3>

    <p>This document is pointed to by a separate document, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/mong-gap/">Mongolian Gap Analysis</a>, which describes gaps in support for Mongolian on the Web, and prioritises and describes the impact of those gaps on the user.</p>
<p>Wherever an unsupported feature is indentified through the gap analysis process, the requirements for that feature need to be documented. This  document is where those requirements are described.</p>
<p>This document should contain no reference to a particular technology. For example, it should not say &quot;CSS does/doesn't do such and such&quot;, and it should not describe how a technology, such as CSS, should implement the requirements. It is technology agnostic, so that it will be evergreen, and it simply describes how the script works. The gap analysis document is the appropriate place for all kinds of technology-specific information.</p>
</section>


  <section id="h_info_requests">
  <h3>Other related resources</h3>

    <p>Initial content for this document drew on Chinese standards work. (EXPAND)</p>
<p>The document <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/typography/">International text layout and typography index</a> (known informally as the text layout index) points to this document and others, and provides a central location for developers and implementers to find information related to various scripts.</p>
<p>The W3C also maintains a tracking system that  has links to github issues in W3C repositories. There are separate links for (a) requests from developers to the user community for information about how scripts/languages work, (b) issues raised against a spec, and (c) browser bugs.  For example, you can find out <a href="https://w3c.github.io/i18n-activity/textlayout/?filter=type-info-request">what information developers are currently seeking</a>, and the resulting list can also be filtered by script.</p>

<h2>Mongolian Script Overview</h2>
    <p>This section introduces the Mongolian script in general terms, providing some context and terminology that is useful in the remainder of the document. If possible, it's best not to introduce actual requirements in this section, but to leave those and detailed descriptions of expected typography to the sections that follow.</p>

  <h3>Punctuation</h3>
<section id="punctuation_rules">
<h4>Punctuation rules</h4>
      <p>There are some specific requirements while using the Mongolian punctuation:</p>
<ol>
<li>Commas, periods, exclamation marks, question marks, or colons cannot be used at the beginning of a line.</li>
<li>Opening brackets cannot be used at the end of a line.</li>
<li>Closing brackets cannot be used at the beginning of a line.</li>
<li>The colon and  &quot;《&quot; of the opening bracket cannot be used separately, which means they must be used together and they are not allowed to be used at the beginning of a line. </li>
<li>Dash consists of two long separators, which cannot be separated, i.e. one cannot be used at the beginning of a line and the other is  at the end. However, it is allowed to appear at the beginning of the line when a paragraph begins.</li>
<li>
<p>Mongolian names of Mongolian punctuation and writing direction are as shown in <a href="#fig_punctuation_sample"></a>, namely the writing direction is the same as that in the graph. <span class="ednote">Need to clarify the meaning of this bullet.</span></p>

<section id="mongolian_space">
<h4>Display rules for Mongolian space</h4>
<p>Mongolian word suffixes are separated from the preceding word using <span class="codepoint" translate="no"><span class="uname">U+202F NARROW NO-BREAK SPACE</span></span>, rather than <span class="codepoint" translate="no"><span class="uname">U+0020 SPACE</span></span>. For example, the code points that make up the suffix  “<span lang="mn"> ᠤᠨ</span>” are: 0x202F  0x1824 0x1828.</p>

  <section id="h_segmentation">
      <h3>Text boundaries &amp; selection</h3>
<section id="selection_rules">
<h4>Selection rules</h4>
      <p>Inline selected text must overlap the Mongolian baseline, as shown in <a href="#fig_selection_single_line"></a>. Multi-line selection must follow the writing direction of the Mongolian script, i.e., text direction from top to bottom and from left to right, as shown in <a href="#fig_selection_multiline"></a>.</p>

      <h4>Cursor movement rules</h4>
       <p>Striking cursor movement keys on the keyboard, including “←”, “→”, “↑”, “↓”, “Page Up”, “Page Down”, “Home” and “End”, should produce movement that follows the writing direction of the Mongolian script from top to bottom and from left to right. For example, the cursor moves to the left after striking the “←” key; the cursor moves to the right when striking the “→” key. The cursor moves down after striking the “↓” key. When the cursor reaches the bottom of the current line, and the key “↓” is pressed again, the cursor will move right and to the top of the next line, as shown in <a href="#fig_cursor_movement"></a>. In the case of the  “↑” key, the opposite  occurs.</p>

<p>The scrollbar will scroll left and right when mouse wheel is scrolling, that is, the scrollbar will move left or the text will move right when mouse wheel is scrolling forward; the scrollbar will move right or the text will move left when mouse wheel is scrolling backward.</p>
    <p>The cursor shape during text editing  (shown in <a href="#fig_mouse_pointer"></a>) must be aligned at the base on the midpoint of the Mongolian script baseline, that is, the midpoint of the Mongolian script baseline  overlaps the midpoint of the cursor, with the length no longer than the middle line between the two lines of the text, as shown in <a href="#fig_cursor_shape"></a>.</p>

  <section id="h_text_decoration">
      <h3>Text decoration</h3>
<p>The “right line” in Mongolian writing is to the right of the text, and is used similarly to the underline of horizontal English and Chinese text. The “left line” is to the left of the text, and is used similarly to the overline of horizontal English and Chinese text. The strikethrough is a baseline-centered vertical line as shown in <a href="#fig_text_decoration"></a>.</p>

<section id="h_textalign">
<h3>Text alignment</h3>
      <p>Text alignment includes &quot;left alignment&quot;, &quot;horizontal centering&quot;, and “right alignment ”, as well as “top alignment”, “vertical centering”, “bottom alignment”and “top-bottom alignment”. </p>
<p>&quot;Left alignment &quot;, &quot;horizontal centering&quot; and “right alignment” are the alignment rules that apply inside a line. “Top alignment”, “horizontal centering”, “bottom alignment” and “top-bottom alignment” are the alignment rules in a page or a paragraph of a multi-line text. </p>
<p>Among &quot;left alignment&quot;, &quot;horizontal centering&quot; and “right alignment”, “horizontal centering” is a default option which means that the Mongolian text will align based on its baseline  axis. “Left alignment” means that the text will move left  a certain distance, which shows obvious differences compared with the text after setting “horizontal center”. “Right alignment” means that the text will move right  a certain distance after, which shows obvious differences compared with the text after setting “horizontal center”.</p>
<p>Among “Top alignment”, “vertical center”, “bottom alignment” and “top-bottom alignment”, “top-bottom alignment” is a default option which means that the words in the upper and the lower boundary of a multi-line text in a paragraph or a page are all aligned. Its alignment method is that spaces in the text are stretched in the same proportion. “Top alignment” means that the words in the upper boundary of a multi-line text in a paragraph or a page are all aligned without considering the alignment of the lower boundary and stretching the space between words. “Vertical center” means the words in the upper and the lower boundary of a multi-line text in a paragraph or a page do not need to align and leave the same blank under the condition of no-stretching space between words.</p>

  <h4>Mixed Arrangement Rules with Numbers and Latin </h4>
  <p>There is no obvious midcourt line in numbers and Latin. Therefore generally, half of the text height is regarded as a midcourt line position. When Mongolian script is mixed with numbers and Latin, the line of half of the text height should be aligned with Mongolian midcourt line. When  font size of numbers is the same as Mongolian’s, it will be slightly larger, so some handling methods should be taken to avoid the problem, such as the methods listed in <a href="#fig_mixed_alphanum"></a>.</p>

<ol>
<li>Chinese and Japanese cannot be displayed in on their side. They must be displayed upright, as in horizontal Chinese or Japanese.</li>
<li>The center line of Chinese or Japanese text (the width in this case) needs to be aligned with the centre baseline of the Mongolian text.</li>
<li>Pay attention to the top alignment and bottom alignment of the Mongolian text. In the same line, the mixed display of Mongolian and Chinese needs attention to produce a balanced alignment. When displayed, it should stretch space, but empty distance or space should not be added in Chinese text. <span class="ednote">Does this mean that no inter-character spacing should be applied to the Chinese?</span></li>
<li> Mongolian is smaller than Chinese or Japanese in the same font size, so some handling methods should be taken to avoid the problem, such as methods listed in <a href="#fig_mixed_cjk"></a>.</li>

    <h3>User interaction</h3>
    <p>All input controls need to be adjusted to match the characteristics of the vertically typeset Mongolian text. For example, controls like text fields and buttons need to support to input and display of text vertically, and furthermore the cursors in text and passwords need to conform to the cursor style as shown in <a href="#fig_mouse_pointer"></a>.</p>

    <section id="select_control">
    <h4>Select</h4>
    <p>The select box appearing in the following HTML code should be displayed as shown in <a href="#fig_select_code"></a>. According to the default setting, the scroll bar is at the bottom and starts at the left. To see the contents at the end of the list, it scrolls from left to right. The scrolling of the mouse wheel should be in accordance with  illustration in <a href="#fig_select_display"></a>. While selecting a column, the selected text and the selected background color should conform to the principle of aligning to the Mongolian vertically-centered baseline (see the descriptions in <a href="#fig_input_controls"></a>).</p>

    <h4>Textarea</h4>
    <p>Textarea is an important control, and is required in the text input, edit, and display. Scrollbar movement accords with requirements of the select control in <a href="#select_control"></a>. The display and moving direction of the cursor should be consistent with the standard for cursor movement in <a href="#cursor_movement"></a>. In some browsers, there are functions for stretching the size of the textarea. The stretching icon should be in the lower right corner, and the  textarea scaling accords with the mouse dragging. The rows and cols attribute of textarea are the opposite of those in horizontal text. Its specific attributes are as the following: rows {int} : showing the column number and cols {int} : showing the row number.</p>

<h4>Mixed arrangement of text and illustrations  (or other non-text objects)</h4>
    <p>The illustrations here include ordinary picture formats, textboxes, charts, media objects and so on, all of which are called illustrations in what follows. There are many ways (as shown in <a href="#fig_mixed_media"></a>) of mixing the arrangements of text and illustrations but, no matter which way is used, some principles need to be obeyed.</p>
<ol>
<li>The illustration cannot be rotated, that is, the original illustration is inserted just as it is. The illustration cannot be rotated into the vertical one just because of vertical text.</li>
<li>The Mongolian script around the inserted illustrations cannot be broken inside the word. The rules of the beginning and end of lines are the same as the original ones.</li>

  <h2>Suggestions about Formulating New CSS Standard</h2>

<ol>
<li>When Mongolian webpage is created, the page direction should be designated: CSS-MONGOLIAN-LAYOUT:Y. Designating the option means that all page elements should be arranged in accordance with the requirement of vertical column script. Meanwhile, there are the main requirements: script should conform to the habit of Mongolian writing -----arrangement from top to bottom and from left to right (see the descriptions in 2.2.3); textboxes, buttons and list order are all displayed in vertical column; pictures, videos and the other third party controls do not need to accord with the requirement of vertical column.</li>
<li>In mixed arrangement with other languages, Mongolian text is X larger than the other texts. Designating the option requires that the size of Mongolian in all control texts should be automatically X larger than the size of the text of other scripts or X smaller under the condition of using minus.</li>
<li>When arranged with other languages, Mongolian should follow the midcourt line aligning principles as the following. when the option CSS-MONGOLIAN-MOVE- WAIST:X px is designated, Mongolian text in all control texts should move X px to left or right so that it can be aligned with the midcourt line of other texts. Because the midcourt line cannot be aligned well under the condition, the option needs to be set.</li>
<li>When arranged with other languages, Mongolian font should be set as  CSS-MONGOLIAN-FONT:MongolianFontName. When the option is designated, Mongolian font in all control texts should be changed into MongolianFontName, while other languages’ font should accord with default font in the system. Because the change of Mongolian font will affect Chinese font when it is arranged with Chinese or other languages and sometimes, Chinese will be displayed in the way of lying down.</li>
<li>Whether Mongolian space (0x202F) is stretched: CSS-MONGOLIAN-SPACE:Stretch|Normal, when the Stretch option is designated, the length of Mogolian space should be stretched as that of normal space. While the option Normal is designated, Mongolian space should not be stretched, and should be displayed in the length of the font library.</li>
<li>Whether the Mongolian vowel space mark MVS (0x180E): is displayed: CSS-MONGOLIAN-MVS:Display|Normal, when the option Display is designated, there will be a small hollow rectangular on the screen with the size in the font library, but the rectangular will not be shown when it is printed. When the option Normal is designated, there will be no picture on the screen, but it will occupy a space of the size in the font library.</li>
