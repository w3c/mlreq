    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <section id="h_about_this_document">
      <h3>About this document</h3>

      <p>This standard describes the Mongolian format standard, which can be used and achieve implementation in the CSS, SVG and XSL-FO, and it can also be used as the reference documents for office software. It mainly focuses on the Mongolian script and its features, the basic module of Mongolian text, page layout, new CSS standard and accessories.</p>


      <section id="scope">
      <h4>Scope</h4>
      <p>The document describes the rules of composition of various types of text written in traditional Mongolian script and pictures, etc. in various network formats. The purpose of this standard is not to provide complete solution, but to describe the important basic information needed in the implementation in a computer.</p>
<p>The main purpose of this document is to provide standardization and guiding rules for the display and application of traditional Mongolian script in the web. However, the more complex layout requirements such as paper layout are not included in this document. Thus, this document includes the most basic rules of display of page and characters of the traditional Mongolian script, aiming at formulating the corresponding standards of web display and application of Mongolian script for the web application vendors to follow this standard of display and application of Mongolian script in the web.</p>

      </section>


      <section id="terminology">
      <h4>Terminology</h4>
      <p>The following terms and definitions apply to this standard.</p>
      <dl>
      <dt>Composition</dt>
      <dd>The composition in the W3C Standard Format includes Mongolian characters, punctuation marks, and other marks related to the script.</dd>
      <dt>Mongolian Space</dt>
      <dd>NARROW NO-BREAK SPACE，U+202F Official term should be: NARROW NO - BREAK SPACE, code: U + 202F Two spaces are used in Mongolian, U + 0020 and U + 202 F. One is a common space: U + 0020, and the other is a Mongolian space U + 202 F.</dd>
      <dt>Mongolian Symbols</dt>
      <dd>It refers to various symbols used in Mongolian text. In formulating the Mongolian coding standard, some of the codes is used in the coding area of the Mongolian standard, while the rest are symbols used in the scripts of other ethnic groups, due to the fact that some symbols are borrowed from other ethnic groups . </dd>
      <dt>Baseline</dt>
      <dd>Baseline in Mongolian is called “Nirogo”. Mongolian writing is generally aligned to the baseline. </dd>
      <dt>Writing Direction</dt>
      <dd>It refers to the default direction of writing. For example, English writing direction is horizontal from top to bottom, while the Mongolian writing is vertical from left to right. </dd>
      <dt>Text Width</dt>
      <dd>Text width indicates the distance from the word at the left start to the word at the right ead in a line in Mongolian, in the equivalent of the height of the horizontal  English or Chinese text writing. </dd>
      <dt>Text Height</dt>
      <dd>Text height refers to the height of a Mongolian word, in equivalent of the width of the horizontal English or Chinese text writing. </dd>
      <dt>Text Spacing</dt>
      <dd>Text spacing refers to the gap between the Mongolian words.</dd>
      <dt>Leftline and Rightline</dt>
      <dd>As the Mongolian writing is vertical, the right line, the left line and the line through is equivalent to the underline and overline in the horizontal English or Chinese text writing . </dd>

  <section id="h_gap_analysis">
  <h3>Gap analysis</h3>

    <p>This document is pointed to by a separate document, <a href="gap-analysis/">Mongolian Gap Analysis</a>, which describes gaps in support for Mongolian on the Web, and prioritises and describes the impact of those gaps on the user.</p>
<p>Wherever an unsupported feature is indentified through the gap analysis process, the requirements for that feature need to be documented. This  document is where those requirements are described.</p>
<p>This document should contain no reference to a particular technology. For example, it should not say &quot;CSS does/doesn't do such and such&quot;, and it should not describe how a technology, such as CSS, should implement the requirements. It is technology agnostic, so that it will be evergreen, and it simply describes how the script works. The gap analysis document is the appropriate place for all kinds of technology-specific information.</p>
</section>


  <section id="h_info_requests">
  <h3>Other related resources</h3>

    <p>Initial content for this document drew on Chinese standards work. (EXPAND)</p>
<p>The document <a href="https://w3c.github.io/typography/">International text layout and typography index</a> (known informally as the text layout index) points to this document and others, and provides a central location for developers and implementers to find information related to various scripts.</p>
<p>The W3C also maintains a tracking system that  has links to github issues in W3C repositories. There are separate links for (a) requests from developers to the user community for information about how scripts/languages work, (b) issues raised against a spec, and (c) browser bugs.  For example, you can find out <a href="http://w3c.github.io/i18n-activity/textlayout/?filter=type-info-request">what information developers are currently seeking</a>, and the resulting list can also be filtered by script.</p>

<section id="h_script_overview">
<h2>Mongolian Script Overview</h2>
    <p>This section introduces the Mongolian script in general terms, providing some context and terminology that is useful in the remainder of the document. If possible, it's best not to introduce actual requirements in this section, but to leave those and detailed descriptions of expected typography to the sections that follow.</p>
    <p class="prompt">Is the script an alphabet, abugida, abjad, syllabary, etc? What are the basic set of characters for major languages written in the script? How does the script work? Are glyphs in the script regularly joined up, as in Arabic, or not? Are there other special features, such as stacking, syllabic clusters and conjuncts, etc. Is there a set of characters used for special purposes, such as transcription? Are multiple scripts used? </p>
    <p class="prompt">What are the basic directional features of the script? Is the script written right-to-left, or bidirectionally? Is is written vertically? If so, can it also be written horizontally, what is the frequency with which it is written one way or the other, and which side is the first line on?</p>
    <p class="prompt"> Are there special considerations about page layout that should be described briefly at this point, eg. Japanese kihon-hanmen?</p>
  </section>

  <section id="h_characters_and_phrases">
    <h2>Characters and phrases</h2>
    <p class="prompt">The following is placeholder text, aimed to give suggestions for content. The questions are only prompts, to help the editor think of topics to address. Actual content will depend on the needs of the script being described. Change and reorganize sections as headings and needed.</p>
    <section id="h_fonts">
      <h3>Fonts and font styles</h3>
      <p class="prompt">What are key fonts and or font styles used for this script? Do italic fonts lean in the right direction? Is synthesised italicisation problematic? Are there standard fallback fonts in use in browsers, and if so do they match expectations? Does the script use fixed-width font glyphs, proportionally-spaced fonts, or a combination? <a href="index#fonts">See available information</a> or <a href="https://github.com/w3c/typography/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Afonts%20label%3Ainfo-req">check for currently needed data</a>.</p>
    </section>



<section id="h_glyphs">
    <h3>Glyph control</h3>
    <p class="prompt">Does the script in question require additional features to support alterations to the position or shape of glyphs, for example adjusting the distance between the base text and diacritics, or changing the glyphs used in a systematic way?  <a href="../index#glyphs_diacritics">See available information</a> or <a href="https://github.com/w3c/i18n-activity/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Aglyphs-diacritics%20label%3Atype-info-request">check for currently needed data</a>.</p>
</section>


<section id="h_cursive">
    <h3>Cursive text</h3>
    <p class="prompt"> If this script is cursive (eg. Arabic, N'Ko, Syriac, Mongolian, etc), are there problems or needed features related to the handling of cursive text? Do cursive links break if parts of a word are marked up or styled? Do Unicode joiner and non-joiner characters behave as expected?  <a href="http://w3c.github.io/typography/index#cursive">See available information</a> or <a href="https://github.com/w3c/i18n-activity/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Acursive%20label%3Atype-info-request">check for currently needed data</a>.</p>

    <section id="h_punctuation">
      <h3>Punctuation</h3>
      <p class="prompt">What are the typical punctuation marks used, and how are they used? (See other sections for information about how quotations work, and how punctuation interacts with boundary detection and line-breaking, etc.) <a href="index#punctuation">See available information</a> or <a href="https://github.com/w3c/typography/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Apunctuation%20label%3Ainfo-req">check for currently needed data</a>.</p>

      <section id="punctuation_rules">
      <h4>Punctuation rules</h4>
      <p>There are some specific requirements while using the Mongolian punctuation:</p>
<ol>
<li>Commas, periods, exclamation marks, question marks, or colons cannot be used at the beginning of a line.</li>
<li>Opening brackets cannot be used at the end of a line.</li>
<li>Closing bracket cannot be used at the beginning of a line.</li>
<li>The colon and  &quot;《&quot; of the opening bracket cannot be used separately, which means they must be used together and they are not allowed to be used at the beginning of a line. </li>
<li>Dash consists of two long separatrix, which cannot be separated, i.e., one is used at the beginning of a line and the other is used at the end. However, it is allowed to appear at the beginning of the line when a paragraph begins.</li>
<li><p>Mongolian names of Mongolian punctuation and writing direction are as shown in <a href="#fig_punctuation_sample"></a>, namely the writing direction is the same as that in the graph.</p>

<section id="mongolian_space">
<h4>Display rules for Mongolian space</h4>
<p>Mongolian case supplementary component display rules and Mongolian space (0x202f) processing.</p>
<p>The inputting of Mongolian case supplementary component into the computer requires the Mongolian space 0x202F first, and then the corresponding Mongolian script. For example, the internal code of the word “<span lang="mn"> ᠤᠨ</span>” is: 0x202F 0x1824 0x1828, among which 0x202F is called Mongolian space, inputted before the Mongolian case supplementary component .</p>

      <h3>Numbers, dates, etc.</h3>
      <p class="prompt">Does the script have its own set of number digits? How are they used, and how frequently? Does the numbering system use base-10, or some other type of base? Does it have special formatting patterns (eg. 12,34,000 in India). What about date/time formats and selection – are non-Gregorian calendars used? How are percent signs used, and do numbers have special decorations (like in Ethiopic or Syriac)?</p>

      <h3>Text boundaries &amp; selection</h3>
      <p class="prompt">What are the basic units of the text, and how are they demarcated, eg. characters, character sequences, syllables, or words?  Are spaces or different symbols used between 'words'? Is it important to treat clusters of characters as a single unit? What should happen if you double- or triple-click in the text, whether or not 'words' are separated by spaces? <a href="index#graphemes">See available information</a>.</p>

      <p>Text alignment includes &quot;left alignment&quot;, &quot;horizontal center&quot;, “right alignment ” as well as “top alignment”, “vertical center”, “bottom alignment”and “top-bottom alignment”. &quot;Left alignment &quot;, &quot;horizontal center&quot; and “right alignment” are the alignment rules inside a line. “Top alignment”, “horizontal center”, “bottom alignment” and “top-bottom alignment” are the alignment rules in a page or a paragraph of a multi-line text. </p>
<p>Among &quot;Left alignment&quot;, &quot;horizontal center&quot;, and “right alignment”, “horizontal center” is a default option which means that Mongolian script will align basing on its “baseline” for axis. “Left alignment” means that the text will move left in a certain distance, which shows obvious difference compared with the text after setting “horizontal center”. “Right alignment” means that the text will move right in a certain distance after, which shows obvious difference compared with the text after setting “horizontal center”.</p>
<p>Among “Top alignment”, “vertical center”, “bottom alignment”and “top-bottom alignment”, “top-bottom alignment” is a default option which means that the words in the upper and the lower boundary of a multi-line text in a paragraph or a page are all aligned. And its alignment method is that “spaces” in the text are stretched in the same proportion. “Top alignment” means that the words in the upper boundary of a multi-line text in a paragraph or a page are all aligned without considering the alignment of the lower boundary and stretching the space between words. “Vertical center” means the words in the upper and the lower boundary of a multi-line text in a paragraph or a page do not need to align and leave the same blank under the condition of no-stretching space between words.</p>

  <h2>Suggestions about Formulating New CSS Standard</h2>

<ol>
<li>When Mongolian webpage is created, the page direction should be designated: CSS-MONGOLIAN-LAYOUT:Y. Designating the option means that all page elements should be arranged in accordance with the requirement of vertical column script. Meanwhile, there are the main requirements: script should conform to the habit of Mongolian writing -----arrangement from top to bottom and from left to right (see the descriptions in 2.2.3); textboxes, buttons and list order are all displayed in vertical column; pictures, videos and the other third party controls do not need to accord with the requirement of vertical column.</li>
<li>In mixed arrangement with other languages, Mongolian text is X larger than the other texts. Designating the option requires that the size of Mongolian in all control texts should be automatically X larger than the size of the text of other scripts or X smaller under the condition of using minus.</li>
<li>When arranged with other languages, Mongolian should follow the midcourt line aligning principles as the following. when the option CSS-MONGOLIAN-MOVE- WAIST:X px is designated, Mongolian text in all control texts should move X px to left or right so that it can be aligned with the midcourt line of other texts. Because the midcourt line cannot be aligned well under the condition, the option needs to be set.</li>
<li>When arranged with other languages, Mongolian font should be set as  CSS-MONGOLIAN-FONT:MongolianFontName. When the option is designated, Mongolian font in all control texts should be changed into MongolianFontName, while other languages’ font should accord with default font in the system. Because the change of Mongolian font will affect Chinese font when it is arranged with Chinese or other languages and sometimes, Chinese will be displayed in the way of lying down.</li>
<li>Whether Mongolian space (0x202F) is stretched: CSS-MONGOLIAN-SPACE:Stretch|Normal, when the Stretch option is designated, the length of Mogolian space should be stretched as that of normal space. While the option Normal is designated, Mongolian space should not be stretched, and should be displayed in the length of the font library.</li>
<li>Whether the Mongolian vowel space mark MVS (0x180E): is displayed: CSS-MONGOLIAN-MVS:Display|Normal, when the option Display is designated, there will be a small hollow rectangular on the screen with the size in the font library, but the rectangular will not be shown when it is printed. When the option Normal is designated, there will be no picture on the screen, but it will occupy a space of the size in the font library.</li>
